https://github.com/drchangliu/MicroRTS

LLM aids are allowed. Claude Code and Codex are top choices. Submit all prompts used along with your reflection on whether they are helpful.

### Timeline:
* In-class discussion: Tuesday Week 6

### Final Due Date: As listed on Canvas.

### Submission instructions: 

* Option 1: build a manually scripted AI from scratch
* Option 2: dissect and modify a built-in AI such as NaïveMCTS
* Option 3: dissect and modify a third-party AI such as Mayari or CoacAI
* Option 4: modify and train a RL agent such as RAI (Scott's 2023 winning AI) or 2L (Local Learner)

### Deliverables: 
* [optional before competition] Deliverable 1: A key idea/improvement highlight summary 
* [after competition] Deliverable 2: Code walk-through presentation
* [before class] Deliverable 3: A bot evaluation report with results of your bot competing against 4 benchmark bots (random, worker rush, light rush, naive MCTS, Mayari, Coac); With WandB reports and diagrams if feasible.

(Submission on Canvas first, later on this page after the tournament.)
